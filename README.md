# stats220

**A little about me**:
- _My favourite food is chicken pasta_
- I am undertaking a degree in computer science and information systems
- I am taking STATS 220 because it is one of the best courses in the University Of Auckland
- I am interested in learning about data scraping and the R programming language 

A food that I would eat for a lifetime:
